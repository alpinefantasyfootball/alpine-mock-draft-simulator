# The room

What sits behind an invite link. One Cloudflare Durable Object per draft:
everyone who follows `jukeff.com/#/draft?room=E8jeVeL` is routed to the same
object, and that object is the only thing that decides what happened.

**Nothing here is deployed yet.** The static site does not load it and does
not need it. A solo mock draft still opens from `file://` with no backend at
all, and that is deliberate — see the multi-user section of `CLAUDE.md`.

## What is where

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `draft-room.js` | The Durable Object. Sockets, storage, the alarm — and nothing else. |
| `wrangler.toml` | Binding and migration. One class, `DraftRoom`. |
| `../room.js` | Who is sitting where, what has been picked, how long is left. Pure. |
| `../draft-engine.js` | The rules of a snake draft. Pure. |

The two pure files are the point. The browser loads them as well, so a client
and the server reach the same verdict about a pick because they are running
the same code, not because two implementations were kept in step by hand.

`draft-room.js` is deliberately thin. If Cloudflare ever stops being the
right host, that file is what gets rewritten; the rules and the room move
unchanged.

## Running and testing it

Needs Node, which this project otherwise does not — the *site* has no build
step and never will, but a server is a thing you deploy. Node is installed
via winget as a user-scope package, so a **new** terminal picks it up; one
that was already open will not.

```bash
npm install -g wrangler
cd worker
wrangler dev --port 8787 --local
```

That runs the real Durable Object runtime locally, with no Cloudflare
account. In another terminal:

```bash
node worker/test-sockets.mjs
```

Thirty assertions over real sockets: two managers joining, seats, host-only
start, wrong-seat refusal, chat, a reconnect mid-draft, a stale build being
turned away — and the one that matters, two submits of the same player on
one turn producing exactly one pick.

`wrangler deploy --dry-run --outdir=<dir>` compiles without an account and is
the quickest check that the bundle is still valid.

Deploying for real needs `wrangler login` and a free Cloudflare account.

## Decisions worth knowing before changing anything

**The first person through the door creates the room** from their own setup
screen and becomes the host. Everyone after gets the room as it already is;
their settings are ignored rather than merged, because a draft cannot be half
twelve-team.

**A stale player list is turned away, not silently accepted.** The generated
data is rebuilt nightly and the CPU wobble reads a player's position on the
board, so someone who loaded the page after a rebuild would compute different
CPU picks and drift apart inside a round. The room pins the version it
started on and rejects a mismatch with both versions named.

**A dropped connection keeps its seat.** In the lobby, leaving frees the
chair. Mid-draft it stays yours and switches to auto, because a lost
connection is usually a tunnel or a locked phone, and handing someone's
roster to a stranger because their train went underground would be worse than
picking for them.

**Rejections go to one person.** A pick that fails is about that manager's
click; broadcasting it would tell nine other people about a mistake that does
not concern them.

**The room never counts down.** It records when the current pick started and
answers how long is left when asked. That is what lets a phone that was
asleep, or someone who just joined, arrive at the same number as everyone
else rather than counting from whenever they woke up.

## Not done yet

- `chooseFor()` returns `null`. The CPU's real opinion needs the board, which
  is a megabyte of generated data the worker does not have. It will either be
  handed it at deploy time or ask the first connected client for it.
- No client. `app.js` does not know rooms exist yet.
- Chat is relayed but not stored, so a late joiner sees an empty room.
- GIPHY is not wired. The key must live here, not in the page — a key in
  client-side JavaScript is public.
