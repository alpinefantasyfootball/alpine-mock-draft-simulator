# Juke

Juke is the brand. **The Draft Room** is the first of several planned rooms
(Waiver, Prospect, Trade, League, Strategy), and the only one that exists —
so for now the site and the Draft Room are the same thing. Name the room in
the app, not the brand: the header says "The Draft Room", Juke sits above it
in the page title and the manifest.

A fantasy football mock draft simulator, built for one specific ten-team
league and now configurable from the setup screen: 8 to 14 teams, 8 to 20
rounds, any starting lineup, and standard, half or full PPR. That original
league is still what every control defaults to.

Live at `jukeff.com`, hosted on GitHub Pages straight off `main` via the
`CNAME` file. **It serves from the domain root, not a project path** — which
is why `manifest.json` uses `start_url: "/"`. A path-scoped `start_url` here
makes the installed app launch into a 404.

## Stack

Plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript. **No framework, no build step, no npm, no
bundler.** Open `index.html` in a browser and it runs. Keep it that way —
the owner is learning web development and a build step would put the
project out of reach.

Python 3 standard library only in the pipeline. No pip dependencies.

## Files

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `index.html` | Markup. Sticky header, tabs, action bar, panels, player sheet. |
| `style.css` | All styling. Colours defined once at the top, reused by name. |
| `app.js` | Everything else: draft engine, CPU logic, analysis, rendering. |
| `back-to-top.js` | The back-to-top button. Its own file because the how-it-works page uses it and has no reason to load `app.js`. |
| `draft-engine.js` | The rules of a snake draft — turn order, legality, the CPU wobble. No DOM, no globals, no dependencies, so a server can run the identical file. |
| `scripts/test_engine.py` | Runs `draft-engine.js` in node/deno/bun and asserts the rules from outside a browser. |
| `players.js` | **GENERATED.** 260 players by ADP. Never edit by hand. |
| `stats.js` | **GENERATED.** Stats, projections, depth charts by Sleeper ID. |
| `scripts/build_players.py` | The pipeline that writes the two generated files. |
| `.github/workflows/update-players.yml` | Runs the pipeline daily at 11:00 UTC. |
| `og-image.png` | **GENERATED.** 1200x630 link-preview card. Rebuild by opening `scripts/build_og.html` in a browser and clicking download. |
| `unmatched.txt` | **GENERATED.** Feed rows that failed to join, plus unscored stat keys. |

## Data

Two free feeds, no keys: **Sleeper** (players, injuries, stats back to 2018,
weekly logs, projections, depth charts) and **Fantasy Football Calculator**
(ADP, one set per scoring format, written to `players.js` as `ADP_SETS`).

**The pipeline stores raw components and no points total at all.** Scoring
lives in `app.js` (`DEFAULT_RULES` and `fantasyPoints()`), so all 38 rules are
editable on the setup screen and everything rescores with no rebuild.
Sleeper's own `pts_half_ppr` is discarded, as it always was, because it bakes
in assumptions we do not share.

**Every points total must go through `fantasyPoints()`.** There is no `pts`
field to read any more, so a direct read silently scores zero.

`STAT_KEYS` in `stats.js` maps each scoreable stat to its short key and is
**generated from `STAT_FIELDS`**, so the Python and JavaScript sides cannot
drift. Anything scoreable must be in `STAT_FIELDS` — a stat that was never
stored can never be rescored, and `build_players.py` fails loudly if a
`SCOREABLE` entry has nowhere to live.

## Conventions

- `app.js` is organised in numbered sections. Keep new code in the right one.
- `render()` rebuilds every panel from scratch on any change. There are no
  partial updates. This is fine at this size and keeps state bugs away.
- Click handling is delegated from `document`, because the DOM is constantly
  rebuilt. Don't attach listeners to elements inside a render function.
- Comments explain *why*, not *what*. The owner reads this code to learn.
- **Two themes, one set of names.** `:root` holds the dark values and is
  therefore the default; `:root[data-theme="light"]` overrides them. A new
  rule may only name a colour that is the same under both themes — brand
  navy, a position solid, or white on top of one of those. Anything else
  has to become a token in both blocks, or it will be invisible in one of
  them. Blue is two tokens for this reason: `--blue` always sits under
  white text, `--link` is blue *as* text on a surface. Orange is two for the
  same reason: `--orange` (#ED6011) is the brand, and it is only 3.34:1
  against white, so anything putting white text on it uses `--orange-cta`
  (#C2410C, 5.18:1) instead.
- **The centred wordmark needs a breakpoint.** `.shell-inner` is
  `1fr auto 1fr`, so each side gets the same width. Below about 540px the
  sides need ~191px of links and get ~110px, and because the links are
  `nowrap` they do not shrink — they spill straight over the wordmark. Under
  700px the header keeps only the burger, the brand and Sign up; How it works,
  Log in, Install and the theme toggle move into the rooms panel.
- **The rooms panel is inside `#shellbar`.** Scope mobile hide rules to
  `.shell-inner`, not the header, or they hide the panel's copies too.
- **Nothing caches `.theme-toggle`.** There are up to three of them and one is
  rendered, so clicks are delegated and `syncThemeButton()` re-queries.

- **One header, two sets of content.** `.shellbar` and `.appbar` share a
  surface, a border and a 1120px centred column, so the Draft Room and the
  landing page read as the same site. Only `.my-turn` and `.urgent` take
  colour, and they carry their own reversed mark and white text. A CPU being
  on the clock is the resting state and must look like the homepage.

- **Two views, one hash route.** `#/` is the landing page, `#/draft` is the
  Draft Room. Hash routing because GitHub Pages has no rewrite to send a real
  `/draft` path back to `index.html`, and because it keeps the back button
  working for someone mid-draft. `applyRoute()` is the only thing that decides
  what is visible; `render()` must never fight it.
- **Leaving the draft is not discarding it.** Navigating home stops the CPU
  timer and the clock and leaves everything else alone, so nothing advances
  off-screen. Returning hands the clock back or restarts the room. Only
  "Discard draft" clears the save.
- **The rooms are written down once,** in `ROOMS` in `app.js`, and rendered
  into both the header panel and the landing grid. Adding a room is one entry.
- **Check a new class name against the existing sheet before using it.**
  The landing section was first called `.home`, which is already the header's
  home button; it inherited `display:flex` and collapsed to zero width.

- **The logo is navy-on-light, and the header is navy.** The mark is inlined
  rather than an `<img>` so the navy half can be reversed to white on the
  header (`.mark-body`) while the swoosh keeps its orange (`.mark-accent`).
  It is 662 × 774, not square — sizing it as a square squashes it.

## Hard-won rules — do not undo these

**Decide a player's type from `player.pos`, never from whether a stat is
present.** Christian McCaffrey threw one pass in 2025, and a check of
`if (stats.pa)` rendered him with quarterback columns and no receiving line
at all. Presence of data is not identity.

**Treat `0` from an API as missing, not as a real zero.** Sleeper returns
`pts: 0` for players it has no projection for. Counting those as valid
projections dragged replacement level toward zero and made every other
player look elite.

**Never hand-edit `players.js` or `stats.js`.** The next scheduled run
overwrites them. Change `build_players.py` instead.

**Nothing about the league shape may be written down twice.** `app.js` has
one `league` object and everything else derives from it — replacement level,
roster limits, the starting lineup, the round a kicker becomes legal, even
the prose in the method notes. The old code spelled "ten teams" out in a
dozen places and carried a hand-picked replacement level that was only
correct for one of them.

**FFC's `teams=` parameter does nothing.** It is echoed back in the response
meta, so it looks like it worked, but 8, 10, 12 and 14 all return the same
rows, the same ADP and the same `total_drafts` — checked across 2024, 2025
and 2026. Only the scoring format actually changes the data. Don't build a
team-count axis on top of it without re-checking that first.

**`gp` on a projection is not a games count for every position.** Sleeper
forecasts a team defense as one aggregate row stamped `gp: 1`, where every
other position carries the real projected week count. Dividing by it made
every DST's per-game figure identical to its season total — Pittsburgh read
93 points and 93.0 per game. Per-game figures go through `perGame(points,
games)`, which takes the denominator explicitly and prints a dash rather
than dividing by a fallback, and DST rows get theirs from `projGames()`.
Kickers were never affected: they carry the same `gp` as skill players.

**Sleeper's projections are coarser than its actuals, and the pipeline has to
reconcile that.** Season and weekly lines carry `fgm_50_59` and `fgm_60p`;
projections carry only the combined `fgm_50p`, and express misses solely as
`fgmiss_50p`. Reading the fine-grained keys alone silently drops every
projected 50-yard field goal — 183 of them — and makes kickers look far worse
than they are. `reconcile()` folds the coarse keys in. Check any new stat
across all three feeds before trusting it.

**`og:image` must be an absolute URL, and it is baked to `jukeff.com`.**
Link previews are fetched by Slack, iMessage and Twitter from their own
servers, so a relative path resolves to nothing. If the domain ever changes,
`index.html` and `manifest.json` both need updating.

**Scores come from ESPN, and nothing else does.** Sleeper's schedule feed
carries no scores at all — only home, away, date and status — so the strip
uses ESPN's public scoreboard endpoint. It is a third feed, it is
undocumented, and it is the only thing in Juke that depends on someone
else's server at run time. So it fails by disappearing: down, slow, blocked,
or changed shape all end at `strip.hidden = true`. It also renders nothing
when there are no games, which is most of February to August. Never let it
throw, never let it show an error, and never let it block a render.

**Escape anything that comes from ESPN.** Every other string on the page is
generated by our own pipeline and goes into `innerHTML` as-is. The score
strip is the exception, so team names and status text run through
`escHtml()` first. Do not follow the surrounding style here.

**Anything an API gives us that we don't use should be visible, not silent.**
Unmatched players and unscored stat keys both get written to `unmatched.txt`
rather than dropped.

**CSS cannot reach inside `<use>`.** The mark is one `<symbol>` cloned into
each header, and `<use>` builds a shadow tree that descendant selectors do
not match — `.appbar .mark-body` silently matches nothing. Custom properties
*do* inherit into it, so per-header overrides set a variable on the `<svg>`
(`.appbar .mark { --mark-ink: #fff }`), never a `fill` on the path.

**The logo is navy-on-light, so it needs `--mark-ink`, not a fixed fill.**
Hardcoding white made it invisible on every light surface, with only the
orange swoosh showing. The token is brand navy in light, white in dark, and
forced white on the navy draft bar.

**`scrollBy({behavior})` beats the stylesheet.** A `prefers-reduced-motion`
rule on the container does not apply to a programmatic scroll that asks for
`smooth`, so the score arrows check the media query themselves.

**Inline SVG needs explicit `width` and `height` attributes**, not just CSS.
A cached stylesheet once let the logo expand to fill the entire screen.

## Testing

- Engine: `py scripts/test_engine.py` — runs `draft-engine.js` outside a
  browser and asserts the snake maths, the turn order, the legality checks
  and the determinism of the CPU wobble. It needs node, deno or bun on PATH
  and says so plainly if none is there rather than looking like a failure.
- Pipeline: `python scripts/build_players.py` — prints counts and writes the
  generated files. Check `unmatched.txt` afterwards. On Windows run it as
  `py scripts/build_players.py`. A bare `python` reaches the Microsoft Store
  stub and fails with "Python was not found" unless the installer's
  "Add python.exe to PATH" box was ticked, which it usually isn't.
- App: open `index.html` directly in a browser. `file://` works because the
  data files load via `<script src>` rather than fetch.
- Before claiming a change works, run a full simulated draft and confirm
  140 picks, no duplicate players, 14 per team, no kicker before round 13.
  Then run one at a different shape — 12 teams, 15 rounds, full PPR — and
  confirm 180 picks, 15 per team, one QB each and no kicker before round 14.
  If the console reports an error naming something the source no longer
  contains, you are looking at a cached `app.js`, not a real failure. Hard
  reload, or serve the folder over `python -m http.server` and use that.

## Don't

- Don't add a framework, bundler, or npm dependency.
- Don't scrape or republish expert rankings, news articles or analyst
  commentary. That content belongs to the sites that produce it.
- Don't commit secrets. There are none in this project and there shouldn't be.
  This gets harder, not easier, once there is a backend: a GIPHY key in
  client-side JavaScript is public, so it proxies through the server.

## Multi-user drafting

This file used to say don't. The owner has decided otherwise, so the rule is
replaced by the terms it happens on.

**Solo mock drafts stay exactly as they are.** Static, no backend, opening
from `file://`, working offline, free to run. Multiplayer is a *mode*, not a
conversion, and the fallback stays a complete product rather than a degraded
one. Anything that makes a solo draft depend on a server is out.

**The rules live in `draft-engine.js` and only there.** With one drafter the
browser deciding what is legal is fine, because there is nobody to disagree
with. With ten people the server has to decide, and the server and every
client have to reach the same verdict, or two managers take the same player
milliseconds apart and the room forks. That is why the engine has no DOM, no
globals and no imports: so both sides can run the identical file.

**The CPU wobble is arithmetic, not randomness,** for the same reason —
`DraftEngine.jitter()` must give every participant the same answer. It reads
a player's board position, so a room has to pin the data version it started
with. The files are rebuilt nightly and a mid-draft change would drift the
boards apart.
